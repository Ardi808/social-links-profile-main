## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Custom fonts with `@font-face`

### What I learned

This challenge helped me practice using **Flexbox** to center content and build a clean card layout.  
I also learned how to load and apply custom fonts with `@font-face`.

css
@font-face {
font-family: inter-bold;
src: url(../assets/fonts/static/Inter-Bold.ttf);
}

body {
display: flex;
justify-content: center;
align-items: center;
min-height: 100vh;
}

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to:

- Improve accessibility by adding better focus states.
- Use rem consistently for spacing instead of px.
- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
